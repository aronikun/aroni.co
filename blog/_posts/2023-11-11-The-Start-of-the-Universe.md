I should write.

First, lets define the universe.

1. *All existing matter and space considered as a whole; the cosmos. The universe is believed to be at least 10 billion light years in diameter and contains a vast number of galaxies; it has been expanding since its creation in the Big Bang about 13 billion years ago.*

It is *believed* to be 10 billion light years across in diameter. I'm assuming its because its really difficult to measure. One, it's big. Two it's expanding. Three, we can only see or measure at the speed of light. It is also odd to add the big bang as a definition as it is an accepted theory. It's a theory and lets not forget that. There are other theories too. I'm not going to list them but there is another one that I like called "The Pulsating Theory", not as catchy as the "The Big Bang Theory".

The pulsating theory assumes that there is a continuous expansion and contraction of the universe, and at its current state, it is expanding. After some time the expansion will slow then eventually stop, then begin to contract; heading towards another Big bang. In this idea, it would be interesting if time was somehow connected to that pulse. But would it even be noticeable or even measurable? If we used a clock to measure something that is bound to a constant, then its measurement would read according to that constant. This means if time itself speeds or slows, clocks would too.

Time is another wobbly topic. Like, what even is it? The oxford has a universe kind of definition:

1. *The indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded as a whole.*

That sounds like a word salad of assumptions to me. When you break down the words in that definition, then put them back together piece by piece; the definition starts to become a little vague.

1. Indefinite *"don't know how long."*
2. Progress *"onward movement to a destination"*
3. Existence *"the fact or state of living or having objective reality."*
4. Regarded *"considered or thought of in a specified way."*

This one requires the entire sentence together to make any sense so breaking it down for my brain to understand is kind of futile. This is probably the best definition you're gonna get though because there's no physical property for time. Time doesn't exist in the realm of objective reality. It does go forward or whichever way the "arrow of time" is pointing.

For it's non existence, it was measured in a number of interesting ways. In ancient time periods with stone and sun positions, water wheels and such then traditionally more mechanical methods, like grandfather clocks and wind up gadgets; then currently there's the Star Wars like reading of electric quartz crystal oscillations. Quartz clocks are accurate, but not accurate enough for space travel. Even the highest quality crystals will desynch by more than a nanosecond every hour (that's a billionth of a second by the way). In two months, that'll be a millisecond. That doesn't seem like much, but that equates to a distance variance of around 300km. That's a pretty big margin of error if you're gunning for mars at at cruise speed - 40K kph for about 500M km, would take you about 6 months. That would give you a variance of about 1000km which would be a long walk back to the station if you off-shot by that much. This is of course assuming you're going in a straight line and not making any adjustments. If there's some kind of autopilot that can make those adjustments for you, then this should be fine, maybe.

Now the most accurate ones are mostly synced to atomic clocks. They read the vibrations of caesium atoms which gives them a boost in accuracy, now losing a nanosecond every four days. So the same distance variance to hit its target would take around 10 years. That's pretty good, but you'd still need those autopilot systems if you were navigating to different solar systems to land on target, or someone who can live a very long time that's pretty good with math and a joystick.

The point of this is that we throw these terms around like we understand them so well, even when the definitions of these words are kind of fuzzy. They're theories. Pretty good ones, but theories none the less. Silly arguments that concur to various things like "Gravity is not real" is stupid, not because the statement is false, but because it's true. Making deluded conclusions from this epiphany will make a person exactly that; deluded.

Often, I hear the question "Do you believe in evolution"?

The conversation usually goes something like:

"Evolution? As in something that changes over time?"

"No, I mean do you believe we came from monkeys?"

"Well, I was a sperm in my dads testicle and came into mums vagina, swam into an egg, then evolved into this. I'm still evolving, this is around stage 3. Maybe you came from a monkey. I didn't."

Or something depending on the mood I'm in. First of all, the premise is ridiculous. We didn't come from monkeys, and we're already monkey like so the comparison is already "believable". To hold a theory or someone's belief to ransom and ironically preach like its some kind of holy truth paints its point oppressor like they're some kind of evil apocalyptic mind slayer; both teachers and preachers. They are the drones of what they accuse others of. People who ask and drill into these kinds of questions often hypocritically use hidden agendas and mislead intentions out of the fear of the thought spiral they accuse others to have.

Ideas are for us and us alone. We chose how we shape them to better understand them. Being for us; lets not impose them, rather; lets share them gently.
